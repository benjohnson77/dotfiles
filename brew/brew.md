When I you first isntall brew the best place to get the install for home brew is to go to the homebrew.org home page and get the one liner. You will need to add and eport line to you .zsh here are some of the things I ended up needing. That are somewhat chick and egg with my .dotfiles. 

edit .zshrc

```vi .zshrc

add

```export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH

```source ~/.zshrc
